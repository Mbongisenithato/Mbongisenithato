# 👋 Hi, I’m Mbongiseni Thato

A passionate **Full Stack Developer** and **Data Engineer** based in Johannesburg, South Africa. I thrive on turning raw data into actionable insights, building robust pipelines, and crafting modular, reproducible software systems that empower teams and communities.

---

## 🧠 My Philosophy
I build with purpose, not just precision. My work is guided by three core traits:

### 🧭 Responsibility  
I take ownership—from commit to deployment. Every line of code reflects accountability, precision, and long-term thinking.

### 🌍 Ubuntu  
I code with community in mind. I believe in lifting others as I climb, sharing knowledge, and building systems that empower—not isolate.

### 🔥 Grit  
I persist through complexity. Whether debugging edge cases or refining documentation, I stay the course with discipline and purpose.

## 🔧 What I Build

- **Modular Full Stack Applications**  
  Designed for clarity, scalability, and reproducibility. I architect APIs, automate workflows, and optimize user-centric data pipelines.

- **Secure Systems & CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Certified in Cybersecurity Analytics. I implement automated testing, vulnerability checks, and continuous integration strategies that ensure trust and reliability.

- **AI-Driven Task Engines**  
  Inspired by AGI frameworks. I fuse generative models, vector search, and multimodal data to build intelligent, adaptable systems.

- **Open Source Contributions**  
  I document, license, and publish with the community in mind. My projects are built to be learned from, built upon, and improved together.
